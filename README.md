# Exploring-Social-Determinants-of-Health-A-Study-of-Housing-and-Economic-Barriers-in-MIMIC-III-

Social determinants of health (SDoH), including housing 
and economic factors, significantly impact patient health 
risks and outcomes. However, the majority of SDoH 
information is embedded in unstructured clinical text 
within electronic health records (EHRs), making it difficult 
to access and utilize for patient care and research. To tackle 
this challenge and harness the potential benefits of 
incorporating SDoH data into clinical decision-making, we 
propose a comprehensive natural language processing 
(NLP) methodology. Our approach explores both 
unsupervised and supervised learning techniques, finding 
that supervised approaches perform better. We then 
compare various supervised approaches, including 
ChatGPT 3.5, to determine the most effective method for 
extracting SDoH information from EHRs. By 
implementing this robust NLP methodology with a focus 
on the best-performing supervised learning technique, we 
aim to unlock valuable SDoH insights, enabling improved 
patient care, early interventions, and data-driven policy 
decisions that contribute to enhanced health outcomes and 
health equity
